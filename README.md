# Influenza Time Series Forecasting

## Overview
Influenza is one of the few epidemics that should not be overlooked. Negligence has
an economic impact on society and can have detrimental financial and emotional effects
on a patient. While everyone is focused on COVID-19-related issues, there is a demand
to pay attention to Influenza and Influenza-Like Illness (ILI), which have a similar impact
on our society. Seasonal influenza virus epidemics are thought to have long-term harmful
health effects on people. Predicting what might occur in the future can help us build the
most effective solutions and prepare for the worst. As a result, the goal of this research is
to see how weather influences the increase in influenza cases in several European countries
and forecast cases for the coming year. 

In this github, we will study the LSTM attention model.

## Data
WHO Flunet [Dataset](https://www.who.int/tools/flunet) data is a web-based platform for virological surveillance of influenza around
the world. This data at the country level is open to the public and is updated on a weekly


basis. The virology data includes counts of influenza virus detection and reports throughout the
world, which aids in the interpretation of epidemiological data. Many academics have utilized
this data set to investigate the implications of the influenza rate of spread, and some have even
used it to forecast influenza epidemics in this work, combining this data set with climate data to
examine the influence of weather and increase influenza transmission rate prediction accuracy.
The Climate Change Knowledge Portal will be used to collect future climate and historical
data. This climate data2
is an online resource that gives users access to global, country-level
and regional data on climate change and growth. The Minimum - Temperature, Maximum -
Temperature, and Average - Rainfall information for European countries will be gathered in
order to look into the influence of these climatic circumstances on influenza reports from the
same areas.
